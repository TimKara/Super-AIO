Well, I got the bug after seeing the GBZ online, but waited a bit and grabbed one of Kite's SAIO Rev 2 boards, as I really wanted a higher resolution screen (I've built other pi portables with the composite screen, and they lack the punch). Funny thing though, I've owned lots of retro consoles, but I still have never owned an original gameboy!

Project Goals
I wanted the end result to look as clean/stock-like as possible. I also wanted all of the internals to be well designed, placed and easy to service. I also wanted a reduced build time by using more all-in-one solutions. Oh yeah, and it has to be fun! The parts chosen represent these goals.

Parts List
These are the parts used in my build, thank you very much to the sudomod community for making a lot of these great parts.

Tools/Supplies Used
I already owned all these prior to this project as I've been doing console repairs/modding for years now. I will say that don't cheap out on a soldering station, a good iron and if you can afford the desoldering gun make all the difference in the world. Also, flux. Lots of flux.
